Yes, you can re-enable the built-in laptop keyboard later by reversing the registry change. Here's how:

üîß To Disable the Built-in Keyboard (PS/2 interface):
Open regedit

Go to:

sql
Copy
Edit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt
On the right pane, double-click Start

Change its value to:

Copy
Edit
4
‚û§ This disables the i8042prt driver (used for PS/2 keyboards and touchpads).

Reboot your laptop. The built-in keyboard and touchpad should stop working.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure an external USB keyboard/mouse is connected before doing this.

‚úÖ To Re-Enable Later:
Just reverse the process:

Open regedit again

Go to the same key:

sql
Copy
Edit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt
Set Start value back to:

Copy
Edit
1
‚û§ This sets it to automatic startup again.

Reboot ‚Üí Your built-in keyboard and touchpad should work again.

Let me know if you'd like me to give you a .reg file you can double-click to disable or enable this setting more easily.
